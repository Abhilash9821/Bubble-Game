# Bubble-Game
simple game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves clicking on a button with a number, and if the clicked number matches a randomly generated number, the player earns points. The game has a timer, and when it reaches zero, the game ends, displaying a "Game Over" message along with the player's score. The score increases each time the player clicks the correct number. The HTML elements are dynamically generated using JavaScript, creating a bubble-popping game with a time limit.
